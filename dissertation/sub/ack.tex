\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
This project is completed under the guidance of my supervisor, Dr Neill Campbell. Thank you for your kind support and advice.

Special thanks goes to the Data Science team at Jagex Games Studio, Cambridge. The exceptional team provided me an invaluable experience on learning more about data during my placement year. Thank you for inspiring me to take on a project of this kind, in particular to my managers, Chris Smith and Simon Worgan. Paul Wilson, a dear friend and ex-colleague at Jagex, provided unequivocal support with queries about the project. Thank you! 

Also, to Stephen Daly, my dearest friend and partner, for supporting me throughout the project. Thank you!

Lastly, for all those who have given me a helping hand through the years, directly and indirectly, thank you.
