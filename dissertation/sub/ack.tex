Special thanks also goes to the Data Science team at Jagex Games Studio, Cambridge,  where I spent my placement year at. The exceptional team provided me an invaluable experience about how the processes of turning large datasets into into useful insights, from feature engineering to visualisation and machine learning. Thank you for providing me with such a unique industrial experience, Chris Smith and Simon Worgan. In particular, Paul Wilson, an ex-colleague at Jagex, provided unequivocal support whenever I had questions about the project.  

Lastly, for all those who have supported me through the years, directly and indirectly, thank you.
