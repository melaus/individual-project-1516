\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
This project is completed under the guidance of my supervisor, Neill Campbell.  

Special thanks goes to the Data Science team at Jagex Games Studio, Cambridge,  where I spent my placement year at. The exceptional team provided me an invaluable experience on learning the processes of turning large datasets into useful insights, from feature engineering to visualisation and machine learning. Thank you for your support and inspiring me to take on a project of this kind, in particular to my managers, Chris Smith and Simon Worgan. Paul Wilson, a dear friend and ex-colleague at Jagex, provided unequivocal support with queries about the project. Thank you! 

Also, to Stephen Daly, my dearest friend and partner, for supporting me throughout the project.

Lastly, for all those who have given me a helping hand through the years, directly and indirectly, thank you.
