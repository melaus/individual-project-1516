Semantic Paint \cite{semantic-paint} We could scan the scene from multiple angles so to learn from the different behaviours of the objects in a scene.

To be certain that depth is a useful metric.

We should compare the effects of different patch sizes. The optimal patch size would give the least noise and outliers, which helps achieving higher accurarcy and precision-recall rates  

There are many factors affecting the accuracy of a classifier.

- More features - colours, orientation \\\\
- Test SVM with more kernels - only tested linear and rbf. \\\\
- Try clustering techniques on our data \\\\
- Test patches with different sizes
